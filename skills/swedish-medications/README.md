[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A medication lookup tool for Swedish pharmaceuticals (FASS database). Built as an **OpenClaw skill** for AI agents, but works great standalone too.

## Features

- 🔍 **Quick lookup** of common Swedish medications
- 💊 **Brand → substance** mapping (Alvedon → paracetamol)
- 📋 **Key info**: dosage, side effects, warnings, OTC status
- 🔗 **FASS links** for complete official information
- 🤖 **AI-agent ready** - works with OpenClaw, LangChain, etc.

## Installation

### For AI Agents (OpenClaw)

```bash
npm install -g swedish-medications
```

Then add to your OpenClaw skills:

```yaml
# ~/.openclaw/config.yaml
skills:
  - swedish-medications
```

### For Codex App

Add the skill to the Codex app by copying this repo into your Codex skills folder:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/birgermoell/swedish-medications.git

# Copy into Codex skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R swedish-medications ~/.codex/skills/swedish-medications
```

Then restart the Codex app. The skill will appear as **Swedish Medications** in the skills list.

Notes:
- The Codex app reads `SKILL.md` and `agents/openai.yaml` from `~/.codex/skills/swedish-medications`.
- If you update the repo, re-copy the folder into `~/.codex/skills/` and restart Codex.

npm install -g swedish-medications
fass-lookup paracetamol
```

```

## For AI Agents

### OpenClaw Skill

This package works as an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill. When installed, your AI agent can:

1. Look up medications when users ask about them
2. Translate between Swedish brand names and substances
3. Provide dosage and safety information
4. Link to official FASS documentation

**Trigger phrases the agent recognizes:**
- "What is Alvedon?"
- "Tell me about paracetamol"
- "Can I take Ipren for headaches?"
- "What's the dosage for sertralin?"

### Using with Other Agents

The module exports clean functions you can wire into any agent framework:

```javascript
const { lookupMedication, findMedication, COMMON_MEDICATIONS } = require('swedish-medications');

// For tool/function calling
const medicationTool = {
  name: "swedish_medication_lookup",
  description: "Look up Swedish medication information by name",
  parameters: {
    query: { type: "string", description: "Medication name (brand or substance)" }
  },
  execute: (params) => lookupMedication(params.query)
};
```
